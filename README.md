Learning Haskell ( Pure functional programming ) Project Based Approach

### Why Haskell?

If you are reading this it means that you are interested in learning Haskell. But what makes this language special?
Its approach to programming can be summarized in five points:

1.	 Haskell belongs to the family of functional languages,

2.	 It embodies in its core the concept of purity, separating the code with side-effects from the rest of the application,

3.	 The evaluation model is based on laziness,

4.	 Types are statically checked by the compiler. Also, Haskell features a type system which is much stronger and expressive than usual,

5.	 Its approach to polymorphism is based on parametricity (similar to generics in Java and C#) and type classes

### Why Pure Functional Programming?

Functional programming is one of the styles or paradigms of programming. A programming paradigm is a set of
ideas and concepts shared by different programming languages. For example, Pascal and C are part of the imperative
paradigm, and Java and C++ mix the imperative paradigm with the object-oriented one. The fundamental emphasis
of functional programming is the empowerment of functions as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be
manipulated as any other data in a program. Functions can be passed as argument to another function, returned as a
result, or assigned to a variable. This ability to treat functions as data allows a higher level of abstraction, and therefore
more opportunities for reuse.

### File names with “meaningful” suffixes (e.g., .lhs or .o) cause the “right thing” to happen to those files.

.hs -
 A Haskell module.

.lhs -
 A “literate Haskell” module.

.hspp -
 A file created by the preprocessor.

.hi -
 A Haskell interface file, probably compiler-generated.

.hie -
 An extended Haskell interface file, produced by the Haskell compiler.

.hc -
 Intermediate C file produced by the Haskell compiler.

.ll -
 An llvm-intermediate-language source file, usually produced by the compiler.

.bc -
 An llvm-intermediate-language bitcode file, usually produced by the compiler.

.s -
 An assembly-language source file, usually produced by the compiler.

.o -
 An object file, produced by an assembler.
